## Python Tutorial
#### Author: Coffee-Fueled-Deadlines

## Introduction
  This tutorial is being created to assist in teaching the Python Programming Language to new members of the coding team.  This Tutorial will cover some basic elements of the language to include:
  
  1. **[Variables](https://github.com/Coffee-fueled-deadlines/PythonTutorial/blob/master/README.md#variables)**
  1. Operators
  1. Statements
  1. Functions
  1. Classes
  1. Objects
  1. Properties
  1. Methods
  
  Each of the above topics can be clicked to bring you to that section of the tutorial.
  
## Variables
  
  A variable, as in mathematics, is a placeholder for information.  This information can take on different Types:
  
  * Integer
    An Integer is considered to be any whole number (positive or negative).
  * Float
    A Float is any number that is fractional (positive or negative) Examples: `3.5`, `.25`, `-7.20`
  * Boolean (Bool)
    A Boolean (commonly refered too as a Bool or a Bool Value) is either `True` or `False`
  * String
    A string is any length or assortment of Text or Numerical values that should be treated
    as numbers.  Examples: `"Cookie"`, `"3"`, `"A"`.  A string is defined in Python as being
    encompassed by single quotes `'` or doublequotes `"`.
    
  Python is a loosely typed language.  Typed, in this sense, is referring to the Variable Type (one of the above mentioned).  THis means that you do not have to specify the variable type prior to assigning a value to it as you would have to in some other Programming Languages.  For instance:
  
```
a = 10       # a is set to the Integer value of 10
a = "Cookie" # a is now set to the String value of Cookie
a = 0.53     # a is now set to the Float value of 0.53
a = True     # a is now set to the Boolean value of True
```

  As seen above, the variable `a` has been assigned and reassigned to all the different variable types without having to specify the type prior to it being set and re-set.  This is what defines a loosely typed language.
  
## Operators
  
  Python, as with all Programming Languages, uses a multitude of operators.  Many of these operators are identical to those used in other languages while others are expressed in a unique way in Python.  They will be listed in a table below:
  
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | The Addition operator.  This will add two variables together.  For Integers and Floats, it'll return the sum of the values.  For strings, it will return the two strings pieced together into one string.  | a = 1 + 5, a = "Hello " + "world" |
